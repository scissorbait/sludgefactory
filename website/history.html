                </summary>
                This isn't safe for me to listen to bro. I'm still high off the
                Denzel/Kenny collab, not to mention the NEW PEGGY? And now we're
                getting PEGGY AND KENNY? Oh good lord I'm not ready for it, I'm
                not ready, it's everything I could've ever dreamed of. BITCH WE
                STRAPPED LIKE DUKE NUKEM!

                </summary>
                This goes WAYYYY harder than I would have expected from All Them
                Witches??? I'm used to their lighter sound, mainly because I
                almost exclusively listen to Sleeping Through the War, but this
                blew me away so hard while I was reading that I had to stop and
                type some code for the first time in a month. "Behold my power"
                with that intense wave of reverb-heavy sound just kinda shook me
                up.

                  💽 8/15/2024 - I LAY DOWN MY LIFE FOR YOU by JPEGMAFIA
                </summary>
                You guys have no idea how badly I needed this. To me, Peggy was
                one of those artists that I always felt had crazy good
                potential, but I just had to wait it out for him to find his
                footing. I admired his experimental, chaotic sound but it didn't
                appeal to me too much outside of a few songs. I thought the
                Danny Brown collab really transformed his style, and we have the
                evolution I've been waiting for on this album, and it's harder
                than I ever could've imagined!! You're telling me this dude is
                taking some already off-kilter hip-hop beats, throwing some
                distorted guitar riffs over it, and then has the audacity to add
                in STRINGS for emotional weight?! This dude does practically
                everything I love in a song to such an insane extent that it
                feels like every song is secretly 3 different micro-songs. When
                people say hip-hop is the new punk, JPEGMAFIA is who they're
                talking about.

                <summary>💽 5/25/2024 - DARK TIMES by Vince Staples</summary>
                I'll admit I really like Vince Staples' earlier music the most
                out of his overall catalog. I tend to like that loud bombastic
                sound... Summertime '06 was hard. With this release though, I
                found this had a nice moodiness to it that wasn't overly
                depressing like I feel his recent albums have been. Nothing
                wrong with depressing... it's just not my cup o' tea lately.
                Maybe I should go back and relisten to his last two records.
                Maybe I was being too harsh on them?

                </summary>
                This dude has the most idiosyncratic flow I've ever heard. I'm
                trying to compare him to any other artist just to make sense of
                what I'm listening to but he does not sound like ANYONE ELSE in
                the game right now. Also he's SO FUNNY I can't stop thinking
                about "we got the block ovulating"!!

                I'm so mad at myself for not listening to this on release.... is
                there ANY reason people were so quiet about this album when it's
                got NO SKIPS??? Every song is so HARDDDD. I'm gonna be so
                annoying about Back n Love.

                Went down a rabbit hole trying to find a non-Soulseek way of
                downloading music because TMC is not available on there.... to
                no avail. Am I really gonna have to order a CD?!

                I've never actually listened to this album all the way through
                and goddamn I love Megadeth. Wasted my youth listening to more
                Metallica than these guys. They're a lil goofy, but it works.

                discover her? The bars are crazy.
