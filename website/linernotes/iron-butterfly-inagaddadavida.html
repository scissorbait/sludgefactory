                <h1>Iron Butterfly - In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida (1968, ATCO reissue)</h1>
                <p><strong>IRON</strong>—symbolic of something “heavy,” as in sound.</p>
                <p><strong>BUTTERFLY</strong>—light, appealing and versatile…an object that can be used freely in the imagination.</p>
                <p>The group was new, the music different. At first their following was limited to the L.A. “underground”—the hip young local fans who listen and keep up on new sounds and trends. That was 1967 and the beginning for the Iron Butterfly. “Heavy” became their first album and first best seller. It was also the introduction of a new sound created by four young men from four different parts of the country who combined their unique musical talents to form what was soon to become known as “the Iron Butterfly sound.” No one member is responsible for the Butterfly sound. All four contribute ideas to each song that is recorded and those ideas are often as different as the four young men themselves. The sound which was introduced on “Heavy” becomes even more prominent in this their second L.P., “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida.” And the musical genius of Doug Ingle, Ron Bushy, Lee Dorman, and Erik Brann becomes even more obvious than before.</p>
                <p><strong>DOUG INGLE</strong> is the Butterfly’s leader and spokesman. His ideas about music are as unique as the group itself and he is constantly thinking of new ways for expression through sound. Doug’s father was a church organist and much of the classical influence of the church is evident in his writing (he wrote “Unconscious Power”/”Possession,” the group’s first single) and playing. He migrated to the West Coast at an early age and is often the most serious member of the group. It was Doug who first founded the Iron Butterfly and originated the name.</p>
                <p>Offstage he is the deepest thinker, but onstage <strong>LEE DORMAN</strong> becomes the humorist and wit of the Iron Butterfly. Lee’s musical training goes back to his pre-teen years and his “heavy” basslines are easily recognizeable in this and the other Butterfly recordings. His unique arranging ideas have been a valuable contribution at every Butterfly phase. A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Lee is another member who spent a great deal of time travelling before finally settling down in San Diego two years ago.</p>
                <p><strong>RON BUSHY</strong> is one of the Butterfly “nomads.” His father, a career man in the military, was always on the go and consequently Ron was able to call about 34 different states “home.” Aside from promoting his musical genius, travel also made Ron one of the most out-going of the four members. Ron is also an outdoorsman who digs fishing, hunting, and skindiving. His drum “training” goes back to the sixth grade when he fashioned his first drum by building a practice pad and cutting out and varnishing his own drum sticks from wood.</p>
                <p>Seventeen-year-old <strong>ERIK BRANN</strong> is the youngest and another “nomad” in the group. One of the most talented young lead guitarists in the country, his musical training began before school and by the time he was seven years of age, he was a concert violinist. Although music has always been his one great love, Erik studied drama and before joining the Butterfly, his acting ability had landed him the lead role in a local play. A native of Boston, Massachusetts, Erik hopes to, one day, continue in the acting field. Right now, however, his only concern is the Iron Butterfly, turtleneck sweaters, bananas, and the fairer sex. </p>
