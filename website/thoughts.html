                  <span class="date">10/13/2024</span> â€” Ohhhh how I mourn the loss of 8tracks (it's still around, just barely functional). Now that right there was an amazing way to share playlists with other people, FOR FREE, in a way that respected the curator's song order. I also loved the whole <em>mystery</em> aspect of what was even on the playlist; y'know, how songs would get revealed as they played. I wish my only options for sharing playlists now didn't require platform integration (like having to keep them updated on Youtube and Spotify at the same time). Obviously in the modern internet hellscape you can't just dump the individual mp3s on your site, but I'm close to tempting fate and just putting some low-bitrade mixes out there for people. Down with music streaming services!!

                  <span class="date">10/4/24</span> â€” Have all the middle aged rock fans left the room? Then it's safe for me to say that T-Pain's cover of War Pigs is better than the original by Black Sabbath. I say that as someone who loooves Black Sabbath! The song gets more upbeat as the song goes on, which I think suits the themes of the song much more. Don't get me wrong, I love the menacing vibe of the original song, but ending with "no more war pigs have the power" and keeping that tone doesn't feel right to me. The tonal difference of both songs reminds me of how black people tend to look toward the future with hope instead of the typical apathetic pessimism you see from white people. T-Pain's version goes from doom and destruction to a celebration of the end of a great evil, which makes the song feel so much more poignant.

                <span class="date">9/30/24</span> â€” Recently copped a
                record/cassette/CD/SD/USB/AUX/radio player with built-in
                speakers and it's kinda changing the game for me. Finally got
                the chance to listen to Mongkok Duel as a result and I feel so
                fulfilled. Now I'm trying to find a better way to organize my CD
                collection... may need to invest in those special CD sleeves
                that let you include jewel case inserts. I don't got any space
                for them otherwise!!
