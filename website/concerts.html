                  <b>Mong Tong</b> -
                  <i>The Chapel (SF), 10/14/2024</i>
                </p>
                Ohhh, what an experience this was! I went with the same buddy as the last Mong Tong show, and I'm glad it was him! The previous show was all Epigraphy (and some Tao Fire I believe), but this one was most of the old stuff, like Mystery and Music From Taiwan Mystery. I can't even begin to describe how amazing it was to see them perform my favorites in person... Dì Fǔ live was especially amazing... I said this last time, but I had no clue how they managed to pull off certain sounds! What a thing to behold! I also really enjoyed the openers, Adam MacDougall and Isaiah Mitchell. I think there were some technical difficulties, but it seemed like they played one long atmospheric piece. The music combined with the kaleidoscopic visuals projected on the walls and ceiling made me feel like I was in Electroplankton. Need to investigate this duo proper sometime!
                <p>As for the physical experience, I had gotten a chance to explore the area around The Chapel for a bit and discovered that I actually love SF. Also, in the spirit of my first psychedelic trip, I took a therapeutic dose of shrooms which really heightened the vibes. I felt like being here, seeing a great band live, with all these other people enjoying the vibe was the exact place I was meant to be. Truly amazing. The venue was more packed than I expected, and there were a rowdy group of guys in the back who were REALLY digging the music. They seemed to be superfans like me! After the show, I bought a poster (signed) and got to chat with the brothers (I only got to speak to Hom Yu last time) and even take a picture with them!! I was even more loosened up than last time so it felt more natural speaking to them and letting them know how much I love their work. Fingers crossed for another 2024 SF show from them!!!</p>

                </p>
                Brought the lads along for this one, and they had fun
                thankfully! Openers were Michael Beach and YHWH Nailgun; we got
                there a little too late for me to have too much opinion on
                Michael Beach, but I ended up really liking YHWH Nailgun! I
                might need to check out some of their other work... I sat
                upstairs with the guys for a bit during the openers, and it was
                pretty cool getting a look at the AV tech guy do his work. Ran
                downstairs once TFS showed up and it was so much funnnnn!! I
                couldn't hear too good but I remember Gareth calling us "you
                American cunts" which just felt great. You Let My Tyres Down
                live ALSO FELT GREAT, that's been one of my favorites for
                ages... there was one I hadn't heard before that had such an
                amazing crescendo I need to go back through their entire catalog
                just to figure out what it was. Desperately need to see them again ASAP.

                This was amazing.... although I was sleepy and made a bit of an
                iffy outfit choice for this concert. I figured it'd be good to
                dress a little more punk since I was going with Cosine (who is
                tiny and cute) so I wore my Doc Martens, but since I still
                haven't broken them in, it killed my heels so I was having a
                hard time jumping and moving like I wanted LMAO. So much for
                moshing!! That being said, I am incredibly glad I went!! The
                energy was absolutely incredible both from the crowd and Peggy.
                Got to hear all my faves too :3 Highlight for me may have been
                the brief Call Me Maybe cover.

                </p>
                WOOHOOO!!!!!!! THIS WAS AWESOME!! I was supposed to go to this
                with my parents, but they flaked so I went with a friend who
                offered to drive me instead. The venue was very small and cozy,
                full of hipsters (as one would expect). First time I haven't
                recognized alot of songs from a band I enjoy, but I think it's
                because they played alot of the new stuff off Epigraphy and the
                latter half was from Tao Fire. It was a real trip to see how
                they actually construct these songs, with the loop pedals and
                vocals I actually thought were samples initially?? I managed to
                nab some merch (including a Tao Fire CD!!!) and actually got a
                chance to talk to the brothers afterward! I'm so happy I got the
                chance to see them live, I had an amazing time. (Also, the
                opener, K'in Sventa is great too! Gotta check his work out.)

                </p>
                Another landmark for me, my first time going to LA! I wasn't
                super duper excited for the show exactly as a moderate Sonic
                enjoyer, but more excited to get out of town for a few days. But
                by the time we actually got there, I got insanely hyped. It was
                a REALLY nice theatre for one thing, way more fancy than we were
                dressed for (I had my Scaring The Hoes shirt on). This was the
                first time I've ever seen an orchestra that was just...
                overjoyed to be performing? The conductor was so excited and the
                musicians looked so proud. The music was even better, cause the
                first song suddenly got my nostalgia going and I even teared up
                a few times. I was going crazy by halfway through the show and I
                never wanted it to end. Like, Crush 40 and Kellin Quinn live???
                Jesus. Transcendent experience.

                </p>
                THE BIG RETURN SHOW... I went to this with a friend and a guy he
                knew. It was actually my first time going out of town without a
                "guardian" (because, technically, I was my buddy's guardian
                LMAO) as well as taking public transport. This was an awesome
                show. In the line, we saw MIKE look out the tour bus and wave at
                us and my buddy (a huge MIKE fan) was overjoyed. Once we got in
                I found myself stuck in a sea of white boys. They stayed flaccid
                during the opening acts (which were fire??) and the second Earl
                came out, they surged forward and I was barely able to breathe
                at this point. It was also crazyyyy how loud these guys were
                cheering and screaming, to the point Earl himself was like "why
                are y'all going so hard for this one?" or something along those
                lines. It was really funny and enjoyable.

                <p><b>Brockhampton</b> - <i>The Warfield (SF), 3/4/2018</i></p>
                I distinctly remember this was during orange jumpsuit era. I
                went with my mom and grandpa and we ended up getting seated in
                the disabled section because my grandpa was using a cane at the
                time :3 Very convenient, else poor ol' man would have had to
                deal with all the teenagers in the pit. The concert was great,
                but it ended up getting cut short for me because of my mom.
                Kinda left a stain on listening to BH for me, but it weren't the
                band's fault lol. Just wish I'd have gotten to see them one last
                time before they broke up to make up for this experience!!!

                First concert I ever went to! Since I was a youngster I went
                with my grandparents and mom and it felt like I was transported
                to heaven when I got there. We had seats up high above the pit
                (where people were fighting LOL. I had an amazing time seeing my
                favorite group in person and they played AWLLLL my favorite
                songs. Also, I swear, William DuVall looked at me some point. I
                dunno how but I seen it and my mom seen it. Transcendent.
