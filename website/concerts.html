              <div class="concert">
              <p><b>Tropical Fuck Storm</b> - <i>The Chapel (SF), 7/6/2025</i></p>
              <p>Bit of a weird day for me, this one. Got a very uncomfortable message about 10 minutes before the venue opened, and I was also disastrously high, but despite it all things were smooth sailing once the show started.</p>
              <p>I was a little surprised by the older demographic of the concert based on what I remember from their last concert, and I could tell many of these older folks were <em>not</em> diggin’ the opening set. The openers, Bill Orcutt and Chris Corsano, were phenomenal. I’m not sure how I’d even describe what it was like – Bill was playing some crazy experimental riffs on his guitar while Chris was doing some insane percussion work. I remember a gong, singing bowls, spinning (?) plates, and a balloon being let out into the mic (and later the crowd). I think I peaked around this time, and despite the doomy/scary vibe of the music, I was loving every minute of it. I even loved it when the sound of the gong gradually got so loud it felt like my eardrums were gonna explode and I actually had to cover them. Never had that happen before!</p>
              <p>As you <em>know</em>, TFS came out a bit after these two and they blew my fuckin’ head off. This time around I was near the stage and could see everything up close…. and MAN, I did not properly appreciate how badass Lauren Hammel on drums is. I could hardly keep my eyes off her the entire show and how she was just putting her ALL into the performance. It was a sight that made me wanna see through my childhood dream of becoming a drummer (and y’know what, time will tell on how that pans out). Halfway through Gareth asked a bunch of audience members if they knew the lyrics to Irukandji Syndrome… bro, if only he had put the mic up to me, I coulda done the whole song. Well, not really, but I am pretty obsessed with that track. Including that track, they played <em>all</em> the bangers and a ton of stuff from Fairyland Codex. Now, according to <a href="https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/tropical-fuck-storm/2025/the-chapel-san-francisco-ca-134595c9.html">setlist.fm</a>, they performed “Moscovium” during the encore… and y’know what, it probably was that song. I thought it was “Paradise”, and now part of me feels like it was actually “Two Afternoons”. In fact I’m pretty sure it was “Two Afternoons” but don’t take my word for it. The point is that I remember them extending the delicious crescendo for WAYYYY LONGER than the album version and it drove me INSANE in the best way imaginable. </p>

              <p><b>Earth</b> - <i>The Chapel (SF), 4/15/2025</i></p>
              <p>Very exciting leadup to this concert! Everybody knows I am a huge fan of Earth, and there was NO WAY I was gonna miss them performing at my favorite venue. I am very familiar with Earth's 90s work, but I've only listened to some of their "prettier" work, like The Bees Made Honey In The Lion's Skull. I hadn't heard Hex: Or Printing in the Infernal Method yet, but I decided to leave it as a surprise for when I actually came to the show. I <em>did</em>, however, check the first song because I wanted my buddy to come along with me. He's not a big metal fan, so I wanted to avoid something too heavy for him.</p>
              <p>The show was a real trip! I was a bit worried because I had been feeling a bit nauseous and achy, but we got a good view from the upper balcony. Stebmo opened the show with a couple pretty songs on the piano, which kind of gave me a nice, tranquil Animal Crossing vibe. Sandwiched between the songs was a bit of a heartfelt speech about the effect music has on us on a spiritual and mathematic level, and how we can take this moment to feel it on a deeper level instead of having to find "answers". I vibed with what he was saying hardcore. Steve also performed with the band, since he was with them during the production of Hex!</p>
              <p>Steve brought up something about how we can hear notes that are technically different, but sound the same to us (i.e. octaves). That really clicked for me when I saw them all hitting the same notes during the performance: Bill Herzog on bass, Dylan Carlson on guitar, and Steve on trombone. It hits on the recording already, but live I could really feel it resonating throughout my whole body. It was also a trip seeing how they do these songs live. When I'm playing music I tend to play a bit fast if I don't have a drum track/metronome, and in rhythm games I struggle with slow/easy songs. Seeing them play so SLOW but still jamming was awesome. Adrienne on drums was awesome, watching her play essentially in slow-mo was a real sight.</p>
              <p>They played the entirety of Hex and ended with Old Black and a new track that <em>should</em> be on their new album next year, but who knows! It really was amazing. Also, being that this is my first listen of Hex in it's entirety, I gotta say... Earth certainly knows how to end an album! A ton of artists (in my opinion) tend to make the second-to-last song of an album feel like the end, and the ACTUAL final track feels more like a bonus track that should've been in the middle somewhere. I could tell just from listening that I was hearing the final track of Hex; they know how to nail a vibe of finality that really sticks with you. I hope they come back to SF soon!!! For now, I get to rock the cool t-shirt I got at the show in eternal tribute.</p>

                  <b>Acid King</b> -
                  <i>The Chapel (SF), 11/15/2024</i>
               </p>
               This has got to be, by far, the most exciting concert experience I've EVER HAD. I went to this one solo, because I figured nobody I knew would enjoy the music (or vibe) in the slightest. It was a little anxiety-inducing, since I've never been in a big city on my own, let alone at night! I ended up bringing a cane for security <em>and</em> because I headed out way early, so I figured I'd be walking around alot. Anyway, I had NEVER heard of ANY of the bands who would be performing: Castle Rat, Early Moods, and Acid King. I bought the ticket on a whim because a band called "Acid King" sounded right up my alley. Boy, was I right... and I ALSO wasn't expecting to enjoy the other acts so much! It was definitely a great idea not investigating these bands beforehand, because I got to be surprised by how amazing they all were.
               <p>Castle Rat fucking blew me away. It felt like an 80's medieval fantasy pulp novel came to life, backed by DOOM METAL no less! The costumes went crazy, the lead singer looked like one of the scantily clad warrior princesses you would expect to be on the cover of a book with yellowing pages. She also looked at me a couple times and it made my brain go haywire. The little ... (what do I even call it?) bits of lore between songs were so enchanting, and the part where the singer had red blood-potion dripping out of her mouth went so hard. They got a new fan FOR SURE. Early Moods were also friggin' awesome, although this is where one of The Chapel's flaws as a venue comes to light: I could not hear a peep from the singer, and his ass was YELLING.<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> I'll have to check them out on my own later for that, because I did indeed enjoy what I heard. Their doom sound really scratches an itch in my brain, where there's alot of spaces in the song for repetitive (positive) jamming, like you'd get in plain ol' stoner metal.</p>
               <p>Which brings me to Acid King, which I don't have much to say about in general. That's not because I disliked them, but because I was sort of... put in a trance by their repetitive riffage, so much so that it felt like I was BECOMING the fuzz. That may or may not be related to shrooms, and the joint being passed around, but the point still stands. I was also deeply fascinated by the bassist, Bryce Shelton, who was pretty directly interacting with the crowd. One guy brought him a cup of whiskey and another guy handed him his vape, which he took a LONG hit off while jamming out on bass, resorting to only playing with the fretting hand as he handed it back. That's a true pro. His picking technique was also fun to watch; you can tell he is very familiar with his instrument, like they're one and the same. He inspired me to really want to seriously take up bass again, which I got to tell him after the show.</p>
               <p>Since I've been in a pretty piss-poor mood lately I was worried I would have a bad time... and I was feeling a bit shitty at first, leaning against the wall as everyone socialized before the show started. That wore off mighty quick once the show actually started. After Castle Rat, an older man started up a conversation with me about how amazing the Bay Area music scene is. He disappeared a bit before the Early Moods came out after encouraging me to get back into performing and finding people to jam with. By that time, the crowd almost completely turned into a mosh pit and I ended up on the right side of the floor to the left. I couldn't help grinning and laughing while I was being knocked around like a pinball while others were crowd surfing. An older guy behind me got so drunk he had to hold onto my shoulders to steady himself. Then there was the joint being passed around, which really made me feel like a Real Person around Real People. Heading out, I nearly got dragged along to a bar by some of the bassist's friends... which I WOULD have gladly accepted if I wasn't broke and didn't have to catch a train before they stopped running for the night.</p>
               <p>Overall, I had an amazing time. I really felt like I was <em>part of</em> something that night, like I'd found my <em>people</em>. It was a healing experience, one that could not be replicated by a solo walk through nature or any number of self-help books. This concert felt like a religious gathering, and I intend to seek out more like it with great urgency.</p>
               <aside id="1">
                  <sup>1</sup> This was also a problem with Acid King's sound setup, although I could hear hints of the general melody at the very least. I think it can MAYBE be forgiven since stoner metal vocals tend to be more "instrumental" than being particularly stand-out... not to say her vocals were bad (when I could hear them slipping through)! Castle Rat's vocals were pretty crisp though, which was interesting. I initially thought the issue was the vocalists having a higher register, but the Rat Queen even screamed at one point and that came through perfectly (and did NOT blow out my ears).

                  <b>Mong Tong</b> -
                  <i>The Chapel (SF), 10/14/2024</i>
                </p>
                Ohhh, what an experience this was! I went with the same buddy as the last Mong Tong show, and I'm glad it was him! The previous show was all Epigraphy (and some Tao Fire I believe), but this one was most of the old stuff, like Mystery and Music From Taiwan Mystery. I can't even begin to describe how amazing it was to see them perform my favorites in person... Dì Fǔ live was especially amazing... I said this last time, but I had no clue how they managed to pull off certain sounds! What a thing to behold! I also really enjoyed the openers, Adam MacDougall and Isaiah Mitchell. I think there were some technical difficulties, but it seemed like they played one long atmospheric piece. The music combined with the kaleidoscopic visuals projected on the walls and ceiling made me feel like I was in Electroplankton. Need to investigate this duo proper sometime!
                <p>As for the physical experience, I had gotten a chance to explore the area around The Chapel for a bit and discovered that I actually love SF. Also, in the spirit of my first psychedelic trip, I took a therapeutic dose of shrooms which really heightened the vibes. I felt like being here, seeing a great band live, with all these other people enjoying the vibe was the exact place I was meant to be. Truly amazing. The venue was more packed than I expected, and there were a rowdy group of guys in the back who were REALLY digging the music. They seemed to be superfans like me! After the show, I bought a poster (signed) and got to chat with the brothers (I only got to speak to Hom Yu last time) and even take a picture with them!! I was even more loosened up than last time so it felt more natural speaking to them and letting them know how much I love their work. Fingers crossed for another 2024 SF show from them!!!</p>

                </p>
                Brought the lads along for this one, and they had fun
                thankfully! Openers were Michael Beach and YHWH Nailgun; we got
                there a little too late for me to have too much opinion on
                Michael Beach, but I ended up really liking YHWH Nailgun! I
                might need to check out some of their other work... I sat
                upstairs with the guys for a bit during the openers, and it was
                pretty cool getting a look at the AV tech guy do his work. Ran
                downstairs once TFS showed up and it was so much funnnnn!! I
                couldn't hear too good but I remember Gareth calling us "you
                American cunts" which just felt great. You Let My Tyres Down
                live ALSO FELT GREAT, that's been one of my favorites for
                ages... there was one I hadn't heard before that had such an
                amazing crescendo I need to go back through their entire catalog
                just to figure out what it was. Desperately need to see them again ASAP.

                </p>
                This was amazing.... although I was sleepy and made a bit of an
                iffy outfit choice for this concert. I figured it'd be good to
                dress a little more punk since I was going with Cosine (who is
                tiny and cute) so I wore my Doc Martens, but since I still
                haven't broken them in, it killed my heels so I was having a
                hard time jumping and moving like I wanted LMAO. So much for
                moshing!! That being said, I am incredibly glad I went!! The
                energy was absolutely incredible both from the crowd and Peggy.
                Got to hear all my faves too :3 Highlight for me may have been
                the brief Call Me Maybe cover.

                  <b>Mong Tong</b> - <i>Neck of the Woods (SF), 3/23/2024</i>
                </p>
                WOOHOOO!!!!!!! THIS WAS AWESOME!! I was supposed to go to this
                with my parents, but they flaked so I went with a friend who
                offered to drive me instead. The venue was very small and cozy,
                full of hipsters (as one would expect). First time I haven't
                recognized alot of songs from a band I enjoy, but I think it's
                because they played alot of the new stuff off Epigraphy and the
                latter half was from Tao Fire. It was a real trip to see how
                they actually construct these songs, with the loop pedals and
                vocals I actually thought were samples initially?? I managed to
                nab some merch (including a Tao Fire CD!!!) and actually got a
                chance to talk to the brothers afterward! I'm so happy I got the
                chance to see them live, I had an amazing time. (Also, the
                opener, K'in Sventa is great too! Gotta check his work out.)

                </p>
                Another landmark for me, my first time going to LA! I wasn't
                super duper excited for the show exactly as a moderate Sonic
                enjoyer, but more excited to get out of town for a few days. But
                by the time we actually got there, I got insanely hyped. It was
                a REALLY nice theatre for one thing, way more fancy than we were
                dressed for (I had my Scaring The Hoes shirt on). This was the
                first time I've ever seen an orchestra that was just...
                overjoyed to be performing? The conductor was so excited and the
                musicians looked so proud. The music was even better, cause the
                first song suddenly got my nostalgia going and I even teared up
                a few times. I was going crazy by halfway through the show and I
                never wanted it to end. Like, Crush 40 and Kellin Quinn live???
                Jesus. Transcendent experience.

                </p>
                THE BIG RETURN SHOW... I went to this with a friend and a guy he
                knew. It was actually my first time going out of town without a
                "guardian" (because, technically, I was my buddy's guardian
                LMAO) as well as taking public transport. This was an awesome
                show. In the line, we saw MIKE look out the tour bus and wave at
                us and my buddy (a huge MIKE fan) was overjoyed. Once we got in
                I found myself stuck in a sea of white boys. They stayed flaccid
                during the opening acts (which were fire??) and the second Earl
                came out, they surged forward and I was barely able to breathe
                at this point. It was also crazyyyy how loud these guys were
                cheering and screaming, to the point Earl himself was like "why
                are y'all going so hard for this one?" or something along those
                lines. It was really funny and enjoyable.

                <p><b>Brockhampton</b> - <i>The Warfield (SF), 3/4/2018</i></p>
                I distinctly remember this was during orange jumpsuit era. I
                went with my mom and grandpa and we ended up getting seated in
                the disabled section because my grandpa was using a cane at the
                time :3 Very convenient, else poor ol' man would have had to
                deal with all the teenagers in the pit. The concert was great,
                but it ended up getting cut short for me because of my mom.
                Kinda left a stain on listening to BH for me, but it weren't the
                band's fault lol. Just wish I'd have gotten to see them one last
                time before they broke up to make up for this experience!!!

                (where people were fighting LOL. I had an amazing time seeing my
                favorite group in person and they played AWLLLL my favorite
                songs. Also, I swear, William DuVall looked at me some point. I
                dunno how but I seen it and my mom seen it. Transcendent.
